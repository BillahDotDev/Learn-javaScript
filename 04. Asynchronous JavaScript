// What is Asynchronous JavaScript?

Asynchronous JavaScript lets your code continue running without waiting for a particular task to complete. 
It's like being able to cook dinner while also doing the laundry; you can start cooking, 
then switch to laundry while the food is simmering, and come back to finish cooking when the laundry is done. 
This flexibility helps make your programs more responsive and efficient.

// Callbacks: Handling asynchronous operations with callbacks.
1. What are callbacks?
◦ Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions.
◦ They are invoked (or called back) at some point in the future, typically after an asynchronous operation has completed.


• Promises: Promise states (pending, fulfilled, rejected), chaining, error handling.
• Async/Await: Syntactic sugar for promises, async functions, await keyword.
• Event Loop: Understanding the event-driven nature of JavaScript, the call stack, and the event queue.
