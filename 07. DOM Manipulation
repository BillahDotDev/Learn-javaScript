# DOM Manipulation
------------------

*** What is DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's a programming interface for web documents. 
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM representation of the page, 
which is a tree-like structure that allows scripts to dynamically access and manipulate the content, 
structure, and style of the document. This enables developers to write scripts that can respond to user 
interactions, update the page dynamically, and create interactive web applications. 

*** How does the DOM work?

When a web page is loaded into a browser, the browser parses the HTML markup and creates a DOM tree, 
which consists of nodes representing the elements, attributes, and text content of the page. 
This DOM tree serves as an in-memory representation of the document structure.


*** Key Concepts:

1. Nodes: Every part of an HTML or XML document, such as elements, attributes, and text, 
is represented by a node in the DOM tree.

2. Parent and Child Nodes: Nodes in the DOM tree can have parent-child relationships. For example, 
an element node can be the parent of another element node or a text node.

3. Attributes: Elements can have attributes such as id, class, src, etc. These attributes are also 
represented as nodes in the DOM tree.

4. Traversal: You can navigate through the DOM tree using methods and properties to access and manipulate 
different parts of the document.

5. Manipulation: You can dynamically modify the content, structure, 
and style of a web page using DOM manipulation techniques.
