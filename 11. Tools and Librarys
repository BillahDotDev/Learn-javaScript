# Tools and Libraries


*** Package Managers: npm, Yarn.

JavaScript package managers are essential tools for managing dependencies in your projects. Two of the most popular 
package managers are npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn. Hereâ€™s an in-depth look at both of these package 
managers, their features and how to use them.


** npm (Node Package Manager)
-----------------------------
npm is the default package manager for Node.js, and it is the largest software registry. It allows developers to 
install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects.

* Key Features:
1. Extensive Registry: Hosts over a million packages.
2. Version Control: Manages versions and dependencies of packages.
3. Scripts: Allows you to define scripts for various tasks like testing, building, and deploying.
4. Configurable: Various configuration options for proxies, registry settings, and authentication.


1. Installing npm
npm is bundled with Node.js. To install Node.js (and npm), you can download it from nodejs.org.

* Verify the installation:

                  node -v
                  npm -v

2. Initializing a Project

                  npm init
This command will create a package.json file, which holds metadata about your project and its dependencies.
