# Browser Environment

The JavaScript browser environment refers to the runtime environment provided by web browsers for executing 
JavaScript code. When you visit a website, the browser downloads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files associated with 
that webpage. The browser then interprets and executes the JavaScript code within its environment.


1. DOM Manipulation: One of the primary features of JavaScript in the browser is its ability to manipulate 
the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the structure of HTML and XML documents, 
and JavaScript can modify it dynamically, allowing for interactive and dynamic web pages.

2. Event Handling: JavaScript enables the handling of various events triggered by user actions (e.g., clicks, keypresses, mouse movements). Event listeners can be attached to DOM elements to respond to these events, enabling interactive user interfaces.
