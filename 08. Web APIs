#  Web APIs

JavaScript Web APIs are an essential part of modern web development, allowing developers to interact with various features 
and capabilities of web browsers. These APIs provide functionality beyond what is available through standard JavaScript, 
enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
Let's delve into some of the key JavaScript Web APIs:


1. Document Object Model (DOM):
The DOM API allows JavaScript to interact with the structure of HTML and XML documents. Developers can manipulate 
elements, attributes, and styles dynamically, enabling the creation of responsive and interactive web pages.

2. Event Handling:
JavaScript Web APIs provide mechanisms for handling user interactions and browser events. Developers can attach event 
listeners to DOM elements and respond to events such as clicks, keyboard inputs, and form submissions.

3. XMLHttpRequest and Fetch:
These APIs facilitate making HTTP requests from the browser. XMLHttpRequest has been around for a long time and is 
widely supported, while Fetch is a newer, more modern API that offers a more flexible and promise-based 
approach to handling network requests.

4. Web Storage:
Web Storage APIs (localStorage and sessionStorage) allow developers to store key-value pairs locally in the 
user's browser. This enables the creation of applications that can persist data across 
sessions or tabs without relying on server-side storage.

5. IndexedDB:
IndexedDB is a more powerful client-side database API that allows developers to store larger amounts of structured 
data locally in the browser. It provides indexed access to data, making it suitable for applications that require 
complex data manipulation and querying.

6. Web Workers:
Web Workers allow developers to run JavaScript code in background threads, separate from the main 
execution thread of the browser. This enables tasks such as complex calculations or 
long-running operations to be performed without blocking the UI, improving responsiveness and performance.

7. Canvas and WebGL:
Canvas provides a drawing API for dynamically rendering graphics, animations, and charts directly in the browser using JavaScript. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics using the GPU, enabling high-performance graphics and visualizations within web applications.
