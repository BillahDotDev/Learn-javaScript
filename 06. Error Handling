# Error Handling

1. Try/Catch/Finally:

Try Block:
• The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
• If an exception occurs within the try block, the control immediately jumps to the catch block.

Catch Block:    
• The catch block follows the try block and is used to handle exceptions.
• It takes an error parameter, which represents the error object thrown by the try block.
• You can specify multiple catch blocks to handle different types of errors.
