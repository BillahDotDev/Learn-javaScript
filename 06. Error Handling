# Error Handling

1. Try/Catch/Finally:

Try Block:
• The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
• If an exception occurs within the try block, the control immediately jumps to the catch block.

Catch Block:    
• The catch block follows the try block and is used to handle exceptions.
• It takes an error parameter, which represents the error object thrown by the try block.
• You can specify multiple catch blocks to handle different types of errors.

Finally Block:
• The finally block follows the try and catch blocks (if present) and is executed regardless 
of whether an exception occurred.
• It is commonly used for cleanup tasks such as closing files or releasing resources.
• The finally block is optional.
